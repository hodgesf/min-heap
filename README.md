# min-heap
This repository contains an efficient implementation of a min-heap data structure in Python.


Overview:

A min-heap is a binary tree data structure where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes. This repository provides a Python implementation of a min-heap with the following key features:

Efficient Operations: 
The implementation ensures logarithmic time complexity for essential operations such as insertion, extraction of minimum element, and heapifying.

Flexible Usage: 
It offers flexibility by allowing elements to be added or removed dynamically while maintaining the min-heap property.

Features:
MinHeap class: Provides a class to create and manipulate a min-heap.

Insertion: 
Efficiently insert elements into the heap while maintaining the min-heap property.

Extract Minimum: 
Retrieve and remove the minimum element from the heap.

Heapify: 
Convert a given array of elements into a min-heap.

Usage
Example usage of the MinHeap class:

python
Copy code
# Create a MinHeap instance
min_heap = MinHeap()

# Insert elements
min_heap.insert(10)
min_heap.insert(5)
min_heap.insert(7)

# Extract minimum element
min_element = min_heap.extract_min()
print(f"The minimum element is: {min_element}")
Getting Started
To use this implementation in your project, simply clone the repository and import the MinHeap class:

python
Copy code
from min_heap import MinHeap
